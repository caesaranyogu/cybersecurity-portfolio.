Atlanta,GA

I am passionate about cryptography in relation to blockchain, securing cloud information, security AI and designing security architecture systems.

Career Plans:

I'm a cybersecurity professional deeply passionate about Cloud Security, Security AI and Security Architecture. My work often intersects with cutting-edge technologies, including blockchain, where I explore how decentralization challenges and enhances infrastructure security and financial models.

What drives me is not just the technology, but the opportunity to design resilient systems, anticipate threats, and create proactive security strategies that scale—from companies to city wide infrastructure like water, power and healthcare. I enjoy the complexity of securing distributed environments and leveraging automation, AI, and analytics to stay ahead of evolving threats and build resilient systems.

Whether it’s securing cloud workloads, designing architecture for critical infrastructure, or building intelligence-driven defense systems, I’m committed to helping organizations build secure, sustainable, and future-ready environments.

Proud Experience:

One of the most rewarding experiences in my cybersecurity journey was attending and graduating from Polkadot’s Blockchain Academy, where I deepened my understanding of both high- and low-level cryptographic concepts and the core mechanisms behind blockchain security.

The program provided rigorous, hands-on insight into the secure design of decentralized systems, and it significantly expanded my perspective on the intersection between blockchain technology and modern cybersecurity practices.

Beyond the curriculum, I had the opportunity to support fellow cohort members via Discord, fostering collaboration and shared learning. This experience not only solidified my technical foundation but also reinforced my passion for helping others grow in this space. It was a pivotal chapter that continues to inspire my work across cloud security, security architecture, and threat intelligence—within blockchain and beyond.
